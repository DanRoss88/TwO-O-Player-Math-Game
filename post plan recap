// didnt need as many classes as originally planned 
// more functions in the main than originally planned 
// similar in the aspect of react where all the state changes need to happen
// = at the main.rb or index.rb 
//so next time remember just big classes with small functions, because its OOP
// there can be plenty of helper methods in a class.
// make it simple with the plan for classes then write a plan with helpers
